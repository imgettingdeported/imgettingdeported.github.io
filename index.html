title: I'm getting deported...
---

<h2>I'm getting deported from the United States in 60 days, and I'm willing to try anything to stay.</h2>

<p>My name is Haimin Yie and I'm a New York-based mechanical engineer whose H1-B petition was denied.</p>

<p>I've done my research and I'm going to do anything possible to stay in this country.</p>


<p>Turns out there are visas outside of the H1-B that I can qualify for: </p>

<p>The E-2 Treaty Investor Visa, where I must "enter the United States solely to develop and direct the investment enterprise" and anecdotally raise $500,000 in capital towards it</p>
<p>The P-1 Visa, which is for athletes and entertainers.</p>
<p>The R-1 Visa, which is for temporary religious workers.</p>
